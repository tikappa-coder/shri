      <p class="w3-large">
        In the vedic tradition, cow are worshipped as mother. According to scriptures, there are seven mothers: atma-mata (one's own mother) guroh patni(the wife of one's teacher) Brahmani ( the wife of a Brahmani) raja-patnika( the wife of the king) dhenu (the cow)  
        Dharti (the nurse) and prithvi (the Earth) are all considered mothers. Just as a child feeds on the breast milk of the mother , human society takes milk from the cow. The bull is also considered as the father of human society because just as the father earns to feed the children, the bull tills the earth to produce food grains. So, to kill cows means to end the human civilization.<br/>
        
        A civilized man is , therefore, expected to give all protection to the bull and cows. But, today,people are becoming more and more uncivilized by neglecting such instructions and they are encouraging cow killing.
        In  Rig veda (9.46.4) it is said: gobhih prinita matsaram: one who is desirous of killing the cow is in the grossest ignorance, killing the cow and eating its flesh, civilized men must subsist cest on various milk and agricultural products.<br/>

        
        C) in the srimad bhagavatam it is sad:
        Gavah panca pavitrani: the cows deliver five products and all of them are pure and uncontaminated. The live products received from the cow are milk, ghee, yogurt, cow dung and urine. These five products, called pancha-gavya, are required in all ritualistic ceremonies performed according to the Vedic instructions.<br/>
        
        D)Cow's milk considered the most miraculous food which helps in developing the tissues of the brain that helps in understanding the higher purposes of life. It helps one understand the intricacies of transcendental knowledge. Milk can be transformed in to yogurt, curd, butter, ghee and by combining the milk and milk products with grains; hundreds of palatable dishes can be prepared. The ghee or clarified butter is used not only for   preparing delicacies but also for the sacrificial performances.A patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. Even the urine and stool of cows have medicinal value. Cow dung contains all antiseptic properties and is considered a purifying agent. Cow dung can also be dried and used as fuel. The cow urine and dung are used even for bathing the deities.<br/>


        E)Cow- The Worshipable Animal
        In Vedic society, the economy was based on agriculture and cow protection. Sri Krishna mentions this is the Bhagavad-gita:
        Krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam Vaisya-karma svabhava-jam(Bag 18.44) Five thousand years ago, when Krishna was personally present on his planet, there was enough milk, butter and curd. When there were festivals, the cowherd men would throw yogurt, milk, clarified butter and water upon the bodies of one another. Everyone had sufficient stock of milk and other milk products. Shri Krishna is glorified as the protector off the cow and brahminical culure  <span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey">seasonal</span> ingredients.</p>
